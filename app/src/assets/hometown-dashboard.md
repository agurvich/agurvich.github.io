## Introduction

The Hometown Dashboard is an interactive climate data visualization tool currently installed at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History.
It helps museum visitors explore how climate change might affect their own hometown, connecting global climate models to personal geography.

## Find Your Hometown

Visitors begin by searching for a location they care about—often their hometown.
The dashboard features an interactive world map that makes it easy to locate familiar places.
As users zoom in, smaller towns become visible, encouraging deeper exploration.

## Explore Climate Predictions

### Annual Trends

Once a location is selected, users are presented with long-term projections of temperature trends over the coming decades.
The "Annual Trends" view simplifies large datasets into clear, easy-to-read visuals showing how average yearly temperatures may change under different emissions scenarios.

### Monthly Patterns

For a more detailed perspective, the dashboard also displays monthly climate projections.
These visualizations help users understand how the seasons may shift, with hotter summers or warmer winters, and how these changes vary depending on future greenhouse gas levels.

## Compare Climate Models

Not all models agree, and that uncertainty is part of the story.
The dashboard allows users to switch between different global climate models to see how projections differ.
This reinforces the idea that while details may vary, the general trend toward a warmer climate is consistent.

## Precipitation Insights

In addition to temperature, the dashboard includes monthly precipitation forecasts.
Users can examine how rainfall patterns might change—whether their hometown is likely to see more intense storms, longer dry spells, or shifts in seasonal rainfall timing.

## Conclusion

By allowing visitors to find their hometown and view localized climate projections, the dashboard transforms abstract climate science into something deeply personal.
It’s a powerful way to connect global challenges to individual stories and inspire informed conversations about our planet’s future.

## Learn more about the data

**The data shown here** is from the NASA Earth Exchange (**NEX**) Global Daily Downscaled Projections (**GDDP**) of the scenarios assessed by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (**IPCC**) and is based on simulations of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (**CMIP6**).

**The NEX-GDDP-CMIP6 data** is calculated on a 0.25°×0.25° latitude and longitude grid, which is a system of lines used to map the sphere of the Earth.
In some cases, the temperature in major cities could be higher than what's displayed in the gridded cell because it includes a larger area than just that city.
For example, if you search for a city, such as Los Angeles, CA, the average will include the temperature of Los Angeles (which could be higher than average) plus the surrounding geographical area (which could be lower than average).
