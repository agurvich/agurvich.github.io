Through this research I have developed a novel picture of the connection between the stability of galactic disks and the burstiness of star formation and identified a new out-of-equilibrium phase of galaxy growth I call the firework phase.
In this phase, the galaxy is compact, spheroidal, dispersion dominated, and its total kinetic + thermal energy is up to a factor of 10x larger than the gravitational binding energy. In addition to the existence of the firework phase, I also identified a rapid (1-2 Gyr) transition phase between the firework and thin disk phases which I call the proto-disk phase. In this phase, the galaxy has a net rotation oscillates around equilibrium, and disrupts itself through its own stellar feedback.</p>

<p>I call this novel three phase perspective the rapid disk settling picture.
Initial results from JWST have suggested that disks settled very early in the universe and the rapid disk settling picture may be required to explain where and how we expect galactic disks to form.
Additionally, recent studies of galactic archaeology in the Milky Way enabled by Gaia DR3 are consistent with the three phase picture, and the rapidity of the transitions between those phases, with important differences that may prove to be important constraints on galaxy formation models.</p>]]></content><author><name>Alex Gurvich</name><email>agurvich@u.northwestern.edu</email></author><category term="research" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently working on quantifying the detailed morphological evolution of FIRE galaxies over time.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://alexbgurvi.ch/docs/assets/img/subjects/research/morphology/three_phase_cartoon.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://alexbgurvi.ch/docs/assets/img/subjects/research/morphology/three_phase_cartoon.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Astronomy on Tap: Chicago</title><link href="https://alexbgurvi.ch/docs/outreach/astronomy-on-tap/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Astronomy on Tap: Chicago" /><published>2022-08-31T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-11-22T18:11:38-06:00</updated><id>https://alexbgurvi.ch/docs/outreach/astronomy-on-tap</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://alexbgurvi.ch/docs/outreach/astronomy-on-tap/"><![CDATA[<p>Astronomy on Tap is an international public outreach effort that combines a love of science and trivia with a love of beer.

<p>Firefly visualizations, once built, can be explored by simply visiting a URL without any prior installation. 
Making a new Firefly visualization is simple with the Python Data Pre-processor (PDPP) we provide. 
Though Firefly has mostly been used for visualizing simulations of galaxy formation (my research focus),  if you can load your data into three numpy arrays you can visualize it in Firefly!
Because Firefly runs in a web-browser, it automatically works on (almost) any operating system or device (including smartphones and iPads). 
Firefly also works in VR, combining stereoscopic views with gyroscopic controls to allow users to walk through their data in the real world using a Google cardboard.</p>

<p>Firefly can visualize up to tens-of-millions of particles at once, but for even larger datasets (we’ve tested up to one billion particles) users can take advantage of our progressive rendering scheme which only loads data which lies in the camera’s field of view. 
This is accomplished using a novel data indexing scheme in the PDPP that links the data’s position in realspace to its location on disk using an octree. 
Using this method, we have visualized all of the stars in Gaia DR3, just over one billion stars.</p>

In the simulations, the SFR can change by a factor of 30 in as little as 100 Myr at high redshift, in contrast to the relatively time-steady SFR at low-redshift that remains constant to ~10-20%.
Visualizations of the simulations also clearly show an evolution from a highly dynamic or “exploding” state at early times to a dynamically cold thin disk at late times.
The physics that drive these transitions is still not certain.</p>

<p>However, in this paper I showed that the two transitions coincide and, for the first time, quantified the settling of the galactic disk in the FIRE simulations.
In-so-doing, I revealed that galactic disk settling proceeds rapidly (~1 Gyr) and at the same time as bursty star formation ends, suggesting that a galaxy’s ability to regulate its own star formation rate is tied to whether or not is able to sustain a thin galactic disk. 
Furthermore, I identified a period of evolution early in the galaxy’s history where the total energy outweighs the gravitational binding energy by a factor of 3-10, i.e. the galaxy is dynamic and <em>not</em> in equilibrium.</p>

Mentorship is important for helping people feel like they belong and for giving them advice and making social connections.  
If the pairing is not so great then the relationship can do more harm than good. 
-->
<p>Traditional mentorship structures pair mentors/mentees into “dyads” but there are many axes to mentorship  (emotional, professional, scientific, social, etc.) and it is a lot to expect a single mentor to fulfill all these different needs .</p>

<p>It would be better instead if mentees had an network of mentors that extended beyond their main thesis advisor and indeed such a network was a popular request in the climate survey of our department.
As a result, CIERA’s Social Justice Initiative Coordinating Committee (SJCC) organized the Mentorship Action Team (MAT). 
As a member of the MAT I used my experience from starting the peer mentorship program in <a href="/docs/advocacy/pagsc/">PAGSC</a> to guide the creation of this broader mentorship program. 
In particular I emphasized the need for concrete mentorship support to persist past the initial phase of matching, and helped to build a library of mentorship resources (e.g. articles, guides, and example mentorship agreements). 
To enhance the impact of these resources, the MAT hosts a monthly lunch to discuss mentorship best practices and to give mentors and mentees an opportunity to meet.
Participation in our mentorship network is not required to attend the monthly lunch so that even those members of the department who did not sign up can benefit from exposure to the materials we provide.</p>

<p>Another major contribution I made to the MAT was in the matching algorithm. 
I led the code development and testing for a network graph theory approach to matching mentors and mentees based on survey data. 
The basic idea is to use a Monte Carlo approach of “randomly” assigning mentees and mentors (with some constraints that prioritize junior members).
By defining quantitative goodness-of-fit metrics on each proposed network, we can take the “optimal” network.</p>]]></content><author><name>Alex Gurvich</name><email>agurvich@u.northwestern.edu</email></author><category term="advocacy" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I helped design a hierarchical extended mentorship network powered by network graph theory.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://alexbgurvi.ch/docs/assets/img/subjects/advocacy/ciera_mentorship/bkg_ciera_logo.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://alexbgurvi.ch/docs/assets/img/subjects/advocacy/ciera_mentorship/bkg_ciera_logo.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Dearborn Observatory</title><link href="https://alexbgurvi.ch/docs/outreach/dearborn/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Dearborn Observatory" /><published>2022-08-20T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-11-22T18:11:38-06:00</updated><id>https://alexbgurvi.ch/docs/outreach/dearborn</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://alexbgurvi.ch/docs/outreach/dearborn/"><![CDATA[<p>Every week the Dearborn Observatory is open to the public on Friday nights from 8:00pm-10:00pm for observing and a tour of the telescope run by graduate students; as it has been for the past 130 years!

Instead, we see that stars form very inefficiently over the course of billions of years. This inefficiency is parameterized by the observed Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation, a well known observational fact that the surface density of molecular gas and the star formation rate surface density in star forming galaxies is tightly correlated.  The normalization of the KS relation reveals that star formation proceeds very inefficiently, at a rate of approximately 1-2% per free-fall time. However, the physics by which star formation is regulated to this inefficient state are uncertain.</p>

<p>One class of “dynamical equilibrium” models posits that the star formation rate is connected to the gas surface density by means of pressure. One can derive the KS relation (with both the correct slope and normalization) by equating the weight of the overlying gas at the midplane to the pressure generated by stellar feedback from recent star formation. One benefit of this class of models over other explanations for the KS relation is that they naturally predict variation in the slope of the KS relation (a poorly understood but observed phenomenon) as a function of galaxy composition (in particular, the gas fraction).</p>

<p>Using the FIRE simulations to test the of dynamical equilibrium theory, we find that the weight is balanced by the pressure across the face of the disk. I find that the total pressure is dominated by turbulent pressure from the warm and cold phases near the midplane and thermal pressure from the hot phase at above a few (4-5) gas-density-scale-heights. Intriguingly, the FIRE simulations may additionally show that scatter in the KS relation at fixed gas surface density may correspond 1-1 with deviations from vertical pressure balance though direct evidence of a hard link is difficult to prove.</p>

I thought to myself, this isn’t right. 
The power to visualize images should belong to everyone and so I set out to write a convenient and sensible API for making publication quality images that you could plot stuff on top of. 
Thus, FIRE Studio was born. 
FIRE Studio is named as such because I love movies (science ones but also like, actual movies) and I wanted users to feel like they were in the editing booth turning knobs to make the most fantastic version of their figure/movie (now I mean the science kind) they could.
There are cameras, and “productions” (pre-built visualization scripts that people can riff off of) and utilities for time interpolating data using a novel slope-limiting scheme to avoid spurious artifacts when making high framerate movies (thanks Phil for the inspiration!).</p>

<p>FIRE Studio has a couple of different “modes” (or studios, as I call them).
Users can make column density projections, “two color” projections where the hue is set by one quantity like temperature and the brightness is set by another like density, “three color” projections where different quantities (usually mass in different temperature bins) are projected and colormapped independently and then the R, G, and B channels are blended, and luminosity + dust attenuation maps (mock Hubble images).
Each of these modes shares a common underlying API for setting up the image and can easily be plotted in matplotlib axis objects so you can compose or plot ontop of them.</p>
