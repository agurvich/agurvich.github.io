Column density projections: Display the distribution of mass in a given area.\nb. Two-color projections: Visualize two different data properties simultaneously, such as temperature (hue) and density (brightness).\nc. Three-color projections: Separate data into three different temperature bins, project the column density in each bin, then assign them red, green, and blue color values for a comprehensive view.\nd. Mock Hubble luminosity and dust attenuation maps: Create realistic, Hubble-like images by accounting for starlight and dust effects.</p>\n<p>Each of these modes shares a common underlying API for setting up the image.\nThat way, you can find a camera angle that you like and easily apply it to totally different rendering pipelines to make an easy comparison.\nAdditionally, each FIRE Studio image is plotted on a matplotlib axis object which is returned to the user, so you can easily compose them in subplots or plot contours or annotations on top of them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-importance-of-making-movies\">The importance of making movies</h2>\n<p>Animated visualizations, or \"movies,\" produced by FIRE Studio offer a range of additional benefits compared to their static counterparts.\nOne of the primary advantages is that these dynamic visuals showcase changes over time, allowing researchers to gain a deeper understanding of the evolution of various galactic processes over time.\nAnimated visualizations also allow researchers to identify patterns or trends that may not stick out as much in static images, leading to all kinds of new discoveries and insights.\nAnimated visualizations are also way better at conveying the interconnectedness of various processes within a system since you can see both aspects changing together in sync, which isn't always obvious in a still image.\nFurthermore, animated visualizations are just plain cooler and are more engaging for audiences, capturing attention and fostering a greater appreciation for the science on display.\nThis added engagement can be particularly useful when trying to communicate scientific results to a broader public audience, as it can help make complex concepts more accessible and relatable.\nIf you don't believe me, just check out this video (I recommend making it full screen).</p>\n<figure class=\"figure\">\n    <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\" style=\"aspect-ratio:3\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1EMCYK8FGzg\" title=\"galaxy formation\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay;

<i> middle </i> simulated starlight from all the stars with dust; <i> right </i> simulated starlight from only the youngest stars and without dust (shows where star formation is).\n        Not to brag too much, but this video did win me $200 (and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noFAbbAF-xc\" target=\"_blank\"> this one </a> won me $500). \n    </caption>\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"behind-the-scenes-where-movies-are-made-at-fire-studio\">Behind the scenes where movies are made at FIRE Studio</h2>\n<p>So now that I've sold you on making movies, let's talk about how the sausage gets made.\nFIRE Studio uses a unique slope-limiting scheme to minimize artifacts when creating high framerate movies, ensuring smooth and accurate visualizations.\nThe simulation output is already massive, a single simulation on disk may take up to 5 TB of space.\nThat space is made up of 100s of snapshots in time of the galaxy separated by tens of millions of years.\nA lot can happen in tens of millions of years!\nIf we made a flipbook it would look very jumpy, especially near the center of the galaxy.</p>\n<p>To solve this, we have to interpolate between the different frames.\nThere are a couple of ways to do this, but the one that I've found works best is to take the particles in the simulation and split them into two groups:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>those that won't complete a significant fraction of their orbit between frames</li>\n<li>those that are orbiting quickkly enough to complete a significant fraction of their orbit between frames</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It's fairly easy to determine this by comparing the velocity of the orbit its on and comparing the amount of time between snapshots.</p>\n<p>For the first group, there is a simple solution to interpolation: linearly interpolate along a straight line between points A and B as defined by the snapshots you have.\nThe path the particle takes between A and B can be determined pretty well.\nThe second group is a bit more complicated.</p>\n<p>For the second group, we have to guess the path between points A and B that the particle most likely took through the simulation.\nWe can model this path using the angular momentum of the particle, which defines a circular arc that it moves along.\nThen we can use different orders of interpolation (a straight line, a parabola, or a cubic) to determine how it moved along that path.\nThe higher the order of interpolation, the more accurately you are able to match properties of the particles at both points A and B.\nHowever, higher order interpolation can introduce artifacts.\nThus, we check if there is a change in slope along the path that would suggest an extremum was encountered (PUT A FIGURE HERE FOR THIS).\nIf that's the case, then we go down an order until we stop at a straight line which is impossible to have an extremum.\nThis slope limiter allows us to have the best of both worlds: accurate high order interpolation when we can manage it and no interpolation artifacts.</p>\n<p>If you're looking to simplify your data visualization process and bring your galactic simulations to life, consider giving FIRE Studio a try.\nMore information, tutorials, and the code itself can be found <a href=\"alexbgurvi.ch/FIRE_studio\">on it's homepage</a>.</p>","layout":"post","title":"FIRE Studio","img":"firestudio.png","tags":["astronomy","dataviz","software"],"date":"2022","description":"FIRE studio is a visualization package I created to streamline the process of producing publication-quality images of galaxy formation simulation data. \n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
