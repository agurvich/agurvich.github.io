Every week the Dearborn Observatory is open to the public on Friday nights from 8:00pm-10:00pm for observing and a tour of the telescope run by graduate students. Separately, on the last Friday of every month graduate students and post-docs give outreach lectures and answer questions. I regularly volunteer to operate the Dearborn Telescope for the public observing sessions as well as host the Astronomer Evenings once or twice a quarter.
