Doing as much outreach standing behind folding card tables surrounded by astronomy swag as I do, I found myself answering many of the same questions over and over again. “What should my child do to become an astronomer?” “What’s at the center of a black hole?” “Do aliens exist?” And while I couldn’t answer all of them what I did know was that most people were not interested in the pamphlets I was provided with by my department instructing them on how to become a donor. From this problem the Pathfinders were born. Having grown from the original template focused on my own research, the Pathfinder Editorial Board, which I chair, solicits, guides, and refines educational brochures on basic concepts in astronomy that are continuously added to a growing library. In addition to these science-focused brochures, we periodically compile career trajectories from members of the department to give parents of children of all ages the best advice we can to get their kids excited about astronomy and STEM.
