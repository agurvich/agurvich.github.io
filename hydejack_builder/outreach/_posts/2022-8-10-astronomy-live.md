During the height of the Covid-19 pandemic all in-person outreach in our department was suspended.
In response, Chase Kimball and I designed a new virtual outreach series we titled Astronomy LIVE (Live. Interactive. Virtual. Educational.).
Evoking the vibe of an open mic night with a flexible format and lots of guest appearances, Astronomy LIVE streamed live on Youtube once a month with tons of trivia and fun.
The recordings of our livestreams are available at the [CIERA youtube page](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=ciera+astronomy+live).
As part of the core Astronomy LIVE team, I appeared on every episode either as a featured speaker (talking about alien life in the solar system), an interviewer, a gameshow host and contestant, and a boring old master of ceremonies.
