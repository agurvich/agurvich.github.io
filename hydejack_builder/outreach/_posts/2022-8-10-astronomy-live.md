During the height of the Covid-19 pandemic all in-person outreach was suspended. In response, Chase Kimball and I designed a new, virtual, outreach series we titled Astronomy LIVE (Live. Interactive. Virtual. Educational.). Evoking the vibe of an open mic night with a flexible format and lots of guest appearances, Astronomy LIVE streamed live on Youtube once a month with tons of trivia and fun. The recordings of our livestreams are available at the CIERA youtube page. As part of the core Astronomy LIVE team, I appeared on every episode either as a featured speaker (talking about ~alien life in the solar system~), an interviewer, a gameshow host and contestant, and a boring old master of ceremonies.
