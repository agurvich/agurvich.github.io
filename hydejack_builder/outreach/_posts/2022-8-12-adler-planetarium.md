The Adler Planetarium hosts Astronomy Conversations where professional astronomers staff the Space Visualization Lab (SVL) to demonstrate their research and explain concepts in astronomy to a general audience. The SVL is unique in offering a space with a networked set of 3D enabled monitors and projectors that are all controlled wirelesslyâ€“ allowing the presenter to draw from a bank of tailored visualizations that can be seamlessly cast to any number of specific displays. I staff the SVL monthly as part of a rotating schedule of graduate students, post-docs, and faculty.
