Astronomy on Tap is an international public outreach effort that combines a love of science and trivia with a love of beer.
The Chicago chapter was originally split between Northwestern and the University of Chicago, but the UoC based group went defunct back in 2018. 
That's the same year I ascended to *host-star*, the AoT title for chief organizer of a chapter. 
As host star, I help out by coordinating with venues, choosing and inviting speakers, writing trivia, engaging with audience members during events, and sometimes even giving talks myself.

Nowadays, we are at Begyle Brewing in Ravenswood every ~8 weeks.
