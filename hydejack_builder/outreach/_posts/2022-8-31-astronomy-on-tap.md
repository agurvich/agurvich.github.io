Astronomy on Tap is an international public outreach effort that combines a love of science and trivia with a love of beer. Before the pandemic, the Northwestern based group hosts a quarterly event at bars around Chicago.

I help out by organizing with venues, choosing and inviting speakers, writing trivia, engaging with audience members during events, and sometimes even giving talks myself.
