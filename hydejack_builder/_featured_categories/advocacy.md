I spend a lot of time advocating for graduate students, using my privileged identity and (relative) insulation from retaliation as a result of my independent funding from fellowships to try and effect positive change. 
While a lot of this is hard to quantify (and some I am not able or comfortable sharing) I have tried to articulate my commitment as best I can below.
In particular, I have started two successful mentoring programs in my department: one for grad student peer mentoring and another involving a complex hierarchy of mentors/mentees.
