I am working to adapt versions of the browser-based simulation visualization tool Firefly I co-develop along with Aaron Geller. Firefly is designed to display any three-dimensional dataset. Data is formatted through a simple and easy to use Python interface that allows for powerful control of both the underlying dataset and how it is displayed.

Fireflyâ€™s flexible design allows it to be used with VR headsets and an iPad controller creating the potential for exciting and impactful museum exhibits. In the past, members of the galaxy formation group have brought Firefly to the SVL in order to showcase our research and get feedback on features for the app. You can try an online version with a sample dataset here. If you have any feedback, discover any bugs, or just want to say how much you enjoy playing with it shoot me an email and let me know!
