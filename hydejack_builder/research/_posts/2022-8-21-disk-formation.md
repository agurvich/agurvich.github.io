A prediction of the the FIRE simulations is that the progenitors of star forming Milky Way-mass disk galaxies are irregular galaxies with time-variable (“bursty”) star formation rates (SFRs). In the simulations, the SFR can change by a factor of 30 in as little as 100 Myr at high redshift, in contrast to the relatively time-steady SFR at low-redshift that remains constant to ~10-20%.

The physics that drive this transition is still not certain. In our collaboration, we are investigating the interplay between the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and interstellar medium (ISM) in this context. Recently, our group has shown that the inner CGM virializes and becomes thermally supported (forming a hot halo) at the same time the SFR becomes time-steady. It is possible that the formation of a hot halo is integral to enabling a disk to remain stable by 1) providing pressure confinement of stellar feedback driven outflows and 2) providing a smooth source of accretion onto the galactic disk. In addition to the coincident formation of a hot halo and steadying of the SFR, there are a number of other properties that change at or near the same time. Our current analysis seeks to explore these factors and isolate the key processes at play and the chain of events leading to stable galactic disk.
