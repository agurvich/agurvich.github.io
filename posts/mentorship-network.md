Traditional mentorship structures pair mentors/mentees into "dyads" but there are many axes to mentorship  (emotional, professional, scientific, social, etc.) and it is a lot to expect a single mentor to fulfill all these different needs .

It would be better instead if mentees had an network of mentors that extended beyond their main thesis advisor and indeed such a network was a popular request in the climate survey of our department.
As a result, CIERA's Social Justice Initiative Coordinating Committee (SJCC) organized the Mentorship Action Team (MAT). 
As a member of the MAT I used my experience from starting the peer mentorship program in [PAGSC]({{ site.baseurl }}/advocacy/pagsc/) to guide the creation of this broader mentorship program. 
In particular I emphasized the need for concrete mentorship support to persist past the initial phase of matching, and helped to build a library of mentorship resources (e.g. articles, guides, and example mentorship agreements). 
To enhance the impact of these resources, the MAT hosts a monthly lunch to discuss mentorship best practices and to give mentors and mentees an opportunity to meet.
Participation in our mentorship network is not required to attend the monthly lunch so that even those members of the department who did not sign up can benefit from exposure to the materials we provide.

Another major contribution I made to the MAT was in the matching algorithm. 
I led the code development and testing for a network graph theory approach to matching mentors and mentees based on survey data. 
The basic idea is to use a Monte Carlo approach of "randomly" assigning mentees and mentors (with some constraints that prioritize junior members).
By defining quantitative goodness-of-fit metrics on each proposed network, we can take the "optimal" network.

Title: Building a Hierarchical Mentorship Network for Social Justice and Advocacy: The Power of Network Graph Theory

Introduction:
In this blog post, we'll explore how a passion for data visualization, social justice, and advocacy came together to create a hierarchical mentorship network that goes beyond the traditional dyadic mentor-mentee relationship. We'll discuss the motivation behind the project, the unique challenges it presented, and how network graph theory played a vital role in developing an innovative matching algorithm for mentors and mentees.

Section 1: The Problem with Traditional Mentorship Structures

  Discuss the limitations of dyadic mentor-mentee relationships
  Explain the various axes of mentorship (emotional, professional, scientific, social, etc.)
  Describe the need for a more comprehensive mentorship network

  The limitations of traditional dyad mentorship structures often hinder the growth and development of mentees in various aspects of their lives. In a dyad mentorship, a single mentor is expected to provide guidance on numerous fronts, such as emotional, professional, scientific, and social support. This expectation places an immense burden on the mentor and can lead to the mentor feeling overwhelmed or, in some cases, under-equipped to address the diverse needs of their mentees.

  Moreover, it is essential to recognize that every individual has unique strengths and areas of expertise. Relying on a single mentor to fulfill all the mentee's needs can result in gaps in guidance, as no one person possesses all the necessary knowledge and skills. In turn, this can limit the mentee's growth and development, as they may not receive adequate support in areas where their primary mentor lacks experience or expertise.

  To address these shortcomings, it is crucial to move beyond the traditional dyad mentorship structure and consider a more comprehensive approach. A hierarchical mentorship network provides mentees with access to multiple mentors, each with their own set of expertise and experiences. This networked structure allows mentees to seek guidance from various mentors depending on their needs, ensuring they receive well-rounded support throughout their academic or professional journey.

  The importance of providing mentees with a network of mentors that extends beyond their main thesis advisor cannot be overstated. Such a network fosters a more supportive and nurturing environment for mentees, enabling them to grow and develop in diverse areas. A climate survey conducted in our department revealed that a hierarchical mentorship network was a popular request among department members. This finding emphasizes the need to reevaluate our existing mentorship structures and adopt more inclusive and effective approaches to support the growth and development of mentees.

## importance of ongoing support
A sustainable mentorship network requires not only an effective matching process but also ongoing support and resources to ensure that mentors and mentees continue to grow and thrive in their relationships. The importance of providing ongoing mentorship support and resources lies in several key areas:

Nurturing long-term relationships: Mentorship is not a one-time event; it is an ongoing process that evolves over time. By providing continuous support and resources, mentors and mentees can better navigate the challenges that may arise during their relationship, strengthening their connection and fostering long-term growth and development.

Encouraging mentor and mentee development: The needs and goals of mentors and mentees can change over time. Providing ongoing support and resources ensures that both parties remain up-to-date with relevant information, new techniques, and best practices in their respective fields. This continuous learning process helps maintain a dynamic and adaptable mentorship network.

Fostering a supportive community: A sustainable mentorship network goes beyond individual relationships and extends to the wider community.

## connection between network and network graph theory
Network graph theory is a mathematical approach to understanding the relationships and connections between different entities, such as people, objects, or concepts. In the context of an extended mentorship network, network graph theory helps us visualize and analyze the relationships between mentors and mentees to create a more effective and supportive mentorship system.

In a network graph, entities are represented as nodes (or points) while the relationships between them are represented as edges (or lines connecting the points). In our extended mentorship network, the nodes represent mentors and mentees, while the edges represent the mentorship relationships between them.

The relevance of network graph theory to an extended mentorship network lies in its ability to help us understand, organize, and optimize the connections between mentors and mentees. By using network graph theory, we can:

Visualize the mentorship network: Network graphs allow us to see the overall structure of the mentorship network, making it easier to identify potential gaps, bottlenecks, or clusters in the connections between mentors and mentees.

Analyze the relationships: Network graph theory provides various metrics and tools to analyze the mentorship network. For example, we can measure the "distance" between nodes to find the most efficient path for a mentee to connect with a mentor, or we can analyze the "centrality" of a node to identify the most influential mentors within the network.

Optimize the mentorship matching process: By using network graph theory, we can develop algorithms to match mentors and mentees based on their preferences and needs, ensuring that each mentee is connected to the most suitable mentors. This matching process can be optimized by considering factors such as the mentor's expertise, the mentee's interests, and the overall balance and diversity of the network.

Evaluate the effectiveness of the mentorship network: Network graph theory enables us to assess the performance of the mentorship network by measuring various aspects, such as the connectivity of the network or the satisfaction of the participants. This evaluation helps us identify areas for improvement and adjust the mentorship program accordingly.

In summary, network graph theory is relevant to an extended mentorship network as it provides a visual and mathematical framework for understanding, analyzing, and optimizing the relationships between mentors and mentees. This approach helps create a more effective and supportive mentorship system, ultimately benefiting all participants involved.

Certainly! Here are some analogies between network graph theory concepts/metrics and their potential relevance to a mentorship network:

Degree Centrality: In network graph theory, degree centrality measures the number of connections a node has. In a mentorship network, a mentor or mentee with high degree centrality would be connected to many others. A mentor with high degree centrality could be a highly sought-after advisor, while a mentee with high degree centrality might be involved in various projects and seeking guidance from multiple mentors.

Betweenness Centrality: This metric measures the extent to which a node acts as a "bridge" between other nodes in the network. In a mentorship network, a mentor or mentee with high betweenness centrality might connect different groups or sub-networks within the larger network. Such individuals could play a crucial role in facilitating communication and collaboration across different research areas or sub-disciplines.

Closeness Centrality: Closeness centrality measures how easily a node can reach other nodes in the network. In a mentorship network, a mentor or mentee with high closeness centrality would be able to access a wide range of expertise and knowledge within the network with relatively few intermediaries. This could be beneficial for mentees seeking diverse perspectives and guidance in their development.

Clustering Coefficient: This metric quantifies the extent to which the neighbors of a node are connected to each other. In a mentorship network, a high clustering coefficient might indicate that a mentee is connected to mentors who are also connected to one another. This could lead to a more cohesive and supportive mentorship environment, as the mentors can collaborate and share insights on the mentee's development.

Community Detection: In network graph theory, community detection algorithms identify groups of nodes that are more densely connected within the group than with nodes outside the group. In a mentorship network, community detection could help identify clusters of mentors and mentees with similar interests or expertise. This information can be used to create sub-networks or specialized mentorship programs tailored to specific research areas or disciplines.

Shortest Path: The shortest path between two nodes is the minimum number of edges needed to connect them. In a mentorship network, the shortest path between a mentee and a mentor could represent the most efficient way for the mentee to access the mentor's expertise, possibly through a chain of intermediate connections. This concept can help mentees expand their networks and reach out to mentors they might not have direct connections with initially.

By drawing analogies between network graph theory concepts and mentorship networks, we can gain insights into the structure and functioning of the mentorship network. These insights can help us optimize the mentorship experience, facilitate collaboration, and ultimately create a more effective and supportive mentorship environment.




## Improvements to consider: 
Incorporate additional mentor-mentee compatibility factors: The current algorithm can be expanded to consider other factors that may influence mentor-mentee compatibility, such as communication style, personality traits, work-life balance preferences, or cultural background. These factors can help create more nuanced and personalized matches.

Weighted preferences: Instead of treating all mentor and mentee preferences equally, the algorithm could allow participants to assign weights to their preferences, indicating their relative importance. This would enable the algorithm to prioritize more critical factors and generate better matches.

Adaptive algorithm: The algorithm could be adapted over time based on feedback from mentors and mentees. By incorporating feedback data, the algorithm can learn to make better matches in future iterations of the program.

Multi-objective optimization: Instead of optimizing for a single goodness-of-fit metric, the algorithm could be designed to optimize multiple objectives simultaneously. For example, it could balance goodness-of-fit with diversity and inclusivity objectives, ensuring that the mentorship network fosters a diverse and inclusive environment.

Customizable constraints: Allow users to define their constraints, which can be incorporated into the algorithm. This flexibility will enable the program to adapt to various mentorship programs with different rules and requirements.

Periodic re-matching: The algorithm could incorporate a periodic re-matching feature, enabling mentees to change mentors if their needs or interests change over time or if they find the initial match unsuitable. This feature can enhance the overall mentorship experience and ensure that mentees continue to receive the support they need.

Clustering based on interests or expertise: The algorithm can incorporate clustering techniques to group mentors and mentees based on their interests or expertise. This could help create sub-networks within the larger mentorship network, ensuring that mentees are matched with mentors who have relevant knowledge and experience in their areas of interest.

By incorporating these improvements or adjustments, the matching algorithm can become more effective, flexible, and adaptive, ultimately enhancing the mentorship experience for both mentors and mentees.
